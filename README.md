- 🔭 I’m currently working on some independent coding projects too, ask me about it if you’re curious!
- 👯 I’m always down to collaborate on new ideas with other creators.
- 🤔 2020 Goals: Learn Data Science, Get into a MS Program, and Secure an internship...
- 💬 Ask me about the intersection between data and culture.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to paint, play video games, and read philosophy (snob)…
