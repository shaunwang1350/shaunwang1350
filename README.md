## Iâ€™m a Student, Developer, Data Scientist, Art Historian, and Curator [website]

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning my data science skillsets and learning more about the critical methods on culture in my masters program.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always down to collaborate on new ideas with other creators.
- ðŸ¤” 2020 Goals: Learn Data Science, Get into a MS Program, and Secure an internship...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the intersection between data and culture.
